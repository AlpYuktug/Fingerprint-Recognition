Hey;

Biometric Fingerprint Recognition systems are increasingly evolving. I did a simple Fingerprint Recognition for my lesson. 

I watching this process:
 - Choose Image
 - Convert to Binary
 - Thinning
 - Minutiae
 - Structural Similarity Index (SSIM)

How to Work?

You can choose image from DataBase. And you see all process on axes. Then if you click to "Add to DataBase"; Minutiae image save your file. After, you choose minutiae and recognition other minutiae image.

You can ask question from me: alperen.altug@gmail.com
